      <description>So I have always liked the idea of starting a blog, and I have done so on many occasions. Most blog parts rely on a content management system to deliver said content that I write. However, content management systems have always been a bit of a pain in the ass to use.
I can attest to all these. I have used various such services and platforms, anything from BlogSpot, LiveJournal, to WordPress and to the modern Javascript equivalent of Ghost.</description>
